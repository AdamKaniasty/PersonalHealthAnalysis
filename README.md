## HealthieR - Personal Health Analysis

An application summarizing and showcasing data about four aspects of personal health: **quality of sleep, nutrition, mood and physical exercises**, tracked on popular smartphone applications: Sleep as Android, MyFitnessPal, Daylio and Hevy, respectively. Our goal was to gather often overlooked but crucial data about our wellbeing and present our findings in a creative way.

While HealthieR is, for the most part, a Shiny app written in R programming language, our work includes parts of code written in JS, CSS and HTML as well.
